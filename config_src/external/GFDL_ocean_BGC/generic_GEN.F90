!<OVERVIEW>
! This module contains the generic version of "Generic" Tracers.
! It is a very light-weight module, with minimal FMS dependence.
! It is designed to run with MOM in applications, such as GEOS-5,
! where MOM is being hosted by a non-fms system. It does not depend
! on any ESMF or GEOS-5 concepts. It assumes that all 
! internal chemistry or biology calculations are done by the host 
! system and that the host system has already added all other boundary
! sources. It also assumes that the host system is in charge of initialization
! of the tracers. MOM is only responsible for transport calculations.
! Note that, because of MOM's allocation strategy, it is not currently possible
! to fully share pointers; therefore, using this module may require 
! having multiple copies of the tracers.
!
! The module's only public method is generic_GEN_register, which must
! be called by the generic tracer handler after it has read the namelist.
! The only MOM dependencies are g_tracer_type and the g_tracer_add method.
